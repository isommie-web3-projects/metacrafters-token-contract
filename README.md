# MyToken

MyToken is a simple, secure, and efficient token management system built on Ethereum.

## Description

MyToken contract allows for the creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of tokens, with a focus on security and efficiency. The contract maintains a record of balances associated with Ethereum addresses, and includes safeguards to prevent unauthorized token burning.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up (Using Remix)

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the Remix Ethereum IDE.
2. Click on the "File Explorers" icon on the left sidebar and then click on the "+" icon to create a new file.
3. Name the file `MyToken.sol` and paste the code of your smart contract into this file.

### Compiling the Contract (Using Remix)

1. Click on the "Solidity Compiler" icon on the left sidebar.
2. Select the appropriate compiler version (in this case, `0.8.18`).
3. Click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

### Deploying the Contract (Using Remix)

1. Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" icon on the left sidebar.
2. In the "Environment" dropdown, select "JavaScript VM" for testing purposes. This simulates a blockchain in your browser where you can deploy and interact with your contract.
3. Click on the "Deploy" button. You should now see your contract under the "Deployed Contracts" section.

### Interacting with the Contract (Using Remix)

1. Under "Deployed Contracts", click on the ">" button next to your contract.
2. You'll see various buttons representing the functions of your contract. You can click on these to interact with your contract. For example, you can click on the "mint" button to create new tokens.

### Getting Help (In Remix)

If you encounter any issues, you can click on the "Terminal" icon on the left sidebar to see detailed logs of your actions. This can help you debug any problems.
